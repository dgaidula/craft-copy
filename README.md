* Craft 3
* PHP 7.1

## Multi Staging

At fortrabbit your set up multiple Apps to create multiple environments for your project. 

### Config

Once your Apps are in place, you connect your local environment with each App.

```
# Run this command to setup a new deployment configuration
php craft copy/setup
```

The setup command creates a config files the Craft `/config` folder. You can modify and share them across your team.

### Usage

```sh
# Copy code and db down from 'production'
php craft copy/code/down production
php craft copy/db/down production

# Make changes
# ...

# Copy code and db up to 'staging'
php craft copy/code/up staging
php craft copy/db/up staging
```

### Run scripts before/after commands

Supported commands:

* code/up
* code/down
* db/up
* db/down
* assets/up
* assets/down

Here you can find some use cases: [config/fortrabbit.example-config.yaml](https://github.com/fortrabbit/craft-copy/blob/master/src/fortrabbit.example-config.yaml)

## Trouble shooting

The setup is usually straight forward when the [system requirements](#requirements) are fulfilled. However, depending on your local setup, you may run into errors. May errors are MAMP related and easy to fix:

### Local MySQL connection error

```
$ php craft install/plugin copy
  *** installing copy
  *** failed to install copy: Craft CMS canâ€™t connect to the database with the credentials in config/db.php.
```
**Fix:** Ensure "[Allow network access to MySQL](https://craftcms.stackexchange.com/a/26396/4538)" is ticked in MAMP.

### The mysqldump command does not exist

Find out if you can access mysqldump:
```
$ which mysqldump
  mysqldump not found
```

**Fix:** Add the MAMP bin path to your Bash profile
```
echo 'export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
```

### PHP cli version is lower than 7.1

Find out the php version on the command line:
```
$ php -v
  PHP 7.0.8 (cli) (built: Jun 26 2016 12:30:44) ( NTS )
  Copyright (c) 1997-2016 The PHP Group
  Zend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2016 Zend Technologies
     with Zend OPcache v7.0.8, Copyright (c) 1999-2016, by Zend Technologie
```

**Fix:** Add MAMP php bin path to your Bash profile
```
echo 'export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.1/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile
```

### Composer version conflict

When installing the plugin via composer you may see an error like this:
```
$ composer require fortrabbit/craft-copy:^1.0.0-RC2
  ./composer.json has been updated
  Loading composer repositories with package information
  Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
